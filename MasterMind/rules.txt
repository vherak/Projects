		Welcome to Master Mind :: Space Ranger! 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The evil Zyborgs are invading planet Krypto! All the innocent aliens are 
going to be left homeless if they succeed. It is up to you, space ranger 
    to break the code so we can activate the portal and send them 
	              back to where they came from! 
 
Firstly, we’re going to need your name. Next up, choose your level of 
difficulty: Space Cadet if you want to take it easy, Cosmic Commander if 
you’re up for a friendly challenge and Galactic Hero if you’re up for some 
			mind-boggling code breaking! 
 
Space Cadet = Easy : 4 columns x 10 rows with 6 elements to choose from 
Cosmic Commander = Medium : 5 columns x 12 rows with 8 elements to choose from
Galactic Hero = Hard : 6 columns x 14 rows with 10 elements to choose from 
 
      After that, pick your elements you want to use for the game: 
	       numbers, symbols or words; your choice! 
 
This is how the game works: The code is generated by the evil code maker Master Kaiju 
who guards the portal. You, space ranger will have to break the code by choosing some 
elements at a time and attempting to place them in order that you think will match 
				the secret code. 
 
  After each attempt you make to guess, you will get hints from Zhu, the masters
assistant who is secretly on our side. The hints are as follows: an ‘o’ sign for the 
correct colour in the correct position and a ‘+’ sign for the correct colour but wrong 
position, and an empty slot would mean the colour is not in the code. If you’re really stuck,
you can ask Zhu for a hint(this will reveal an element in the secret code),but he 
		can only give you one, so use it wisely! 
 
The code is broken when your attempt to guess matches the code set up by the code maker.
		You only have up to 10 turns to guess the code!  
 
Scoring: Your score will be calculated depending on the difficulty and the 
		number of tries you took to guess.
