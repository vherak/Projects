The aim of our project is to investigate and learn more about various **Associative Classification** techniques and datasets that were proposed by other researchers, which has improved the technique in terms of the accuracy. Next, we also have to develop and design a novel information-based Associative Classification method. To demonstrate the accuracy, robustness and efficiency of our method, we have to develop a web prototype with the API of the proposed method to demonstrate and visualise the performance of our proposed method.


Our major work activities/ milestones includes:

	1) Finalizing our proposed method/technique for developing an Associative Classification method. There are a few improvements that needs to be finalized, which is to	
		a) Propose on improving on a component of AC, either the ARM, Rule Pruning or fitting the model on different models.
		b) Propose a method that is capable of working on generalized datasets.
		c) Propose a method where AC method is ‘Information-based’ 
	2) Implementing and testing our finalized proposed method/technique as an API.
	3) Testing our API on various UCI datasets to obtain the API’s performance.
	4) Develop a web prototype with the API of the proposed method/technique.


Our project deliverables are:

- [ ] An efficient Associative Classification method that is information-based
- [ ] A web prototype to test our implemented Associative Classification method, which is the API
- [ ] An accuracy test and report produced after running the API in the web prototype
